# Capstone-2-International-Trade

Predicting the trade volumes between countries by using  past  years data  
Problem: 
International trade has many advantages that countries and stakeholders can benefit from. Such as Increased revenues, Decreased 
competition, Longer product lifespan, Easier cash-flow management, Better risk management, Benefiting from 
currency exchange, Access to export financing, and Disposal of surplus goods. 
However, on the other hand, there are some problems and disadvantages of 


international trade. 
The most common problems that countries and stakeholders face in international trades are as follow: shipping customs 
and duties, language barriers, cultural differences, servicing customers, returning products, and intellectual property 
theft. 

Context: 
For several decades now, the Comptes Harmonisés sur les Echanges et L’Economie Mondiale (CHELEM) database [International 
trade flows, balances of payments and world revenues], developed by the CEPII, 
has been recognized as one of the most useful tools to analyze global economic trends 
in a framework combining coherence, exhaustiveness, and reliability.CEPII makes available a "square" gravity 
dataset for all world pairs of countries (224), for the period 1948 to 2015. 


Criteria For Success: 
After analyzing this data we should be able to: 

-predict the  future trade volumes between countries by using 
past years trade volumes? 

-assess the impact of GDP of origin country on trade? 
-Test our prediction against the real data to determine 
its accuracy 

Scope: 
This data is from all world pairs of countries 
(224), for the period 1948 to 2015. 
It would be safe to generalize the results to all counties in the data set. 

Constraints: 
-International trade has some disadvantages such as shipping customs and 
duties, language barriers, cultural differences, servicing 
customers, returning products, and intellectual property theft. 

Stakeholders: 
The Key stakeholders of international 
trade include Government Ministers, other government departments, those involved 
in the international trade supply chain as well as travelers, the public, and 
even the press.
